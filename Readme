## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned

I learnt how to style images with different accents using css --/mix-blend-mode: multiply/--. It took a long time but when i found this property it was a 'Eureka' moment. I still didnt nail the colour as given in the design but it was close enough.The Majority of my time was spent in tinkering with the code to get all the elements like <p> and others to align as close to the design specs. It took some time but i am satisfied with the output after many days of hard work and research. W3s and mdn helped me to shorten my codebase by using padding and margin in a group instead of using them individually.
I hope to reduce the time and increase the accuracy of my projects as I go along  my coding journey.   

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
border-radius: 0 1rem 1em 0;
 padding:0px 60px 0px 0px ;
}



### Continued development

I hope to reduce the time and increase the accuracy of my projects as I go along  my coding journey. And study the various image blend properties.
