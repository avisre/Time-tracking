## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned
Alternative way to center divs using transform translateX-50%. Also realized that position-relative has limits and that it wont work in all cases. 
Also learnt that structuring elements in a page is directly dependent on the height and with of the parent. If you set it too small for instance less than 500px, 
when you enlarge the viewing distance in bigger screen sizes the specs will not appear as you planned originally.
But i learnt that this problem can be easily fixed by using max-width:100vw and min-height:100vh.
 




### Continued development

I hope to reduce the time and increase the accuracy of my projects as I go along  my coding journey. Also want to learn css Grid so that i can arrange my layout faster. 




### Shout Out:
@Grace Snow and JuveriaD from Front-End mentor for helping me out with the Min-height max-width properties. It helped me complete the project in a reasonable time-frame.
