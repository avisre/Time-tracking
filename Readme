## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned
Alternative way to center divs using transform translateX-50%. Also realized that position-relative has limits and that it wont work in all cases. 
Also learnt that positioning a div is directly dependent on the height and with of the parent. 
Finally incorporated max-width and vw and vh to solve the issue.  




### Continued development

I hope to reduce the time and increase the accuracy of my projects as I go along  my coding journey. Also want to learn css Grid so that i can arrange my layout faster.
